## A game about winning
You play by rolling two dice. The AI then does the same. 6 rounds go by like that, and at the end of the 6th round, a winner is declared.
The game has the theme of lucha libre, which incorporates strong and diverse colors as well as an underrepresented culture in the West.
The layout is simple and easy to navigate for new players.
